This file contains the main theorems and proofs of your project.
Organize theorems logically, from simple to complex.

## Structure
1. Import necessary modules
2. State and prove main theorems
3. Include intermediate lemmas
4. Add corollaries and applications

/-! ## Main Theorems -/

-- Example: A main theorem about your definition
-- theorem main_theorem : ... := by
--   -- proof here

-- Example: Another important result
-- theorem important_property : ... := by
--   -- proof here

/-! ## Intermediate Lemmas -/

-- Add lemmas that support your main theorems
-- lemma helpful_lemma1 : ... := by
--   -- proof here

-- lemma helpful_lemma2 : ... := by
--   -- proof here

/-! ## Corollaries and Applications -/

-- theorem corollary_of_main : ... := by
--   apply main_theorem
--   -- additional proof

-- example application : ... := by
